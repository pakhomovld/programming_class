This is a notebook-style repository where I will be documenting all my programming lessons.

I write all my lessons in one language and then translate them into another. For example, I first write them in Python and then translate the code into Go. I do this so I don't have to think in terms of just one language. Also, when translating, I encounter errors for the first time that need to be resolved. I think I learn faster and more effectively this way, and I also think knowing a second language is never a bad thing.

# lesson_1
What is factorial, how to calculate it. What is recursive, how to write recursive function.
# lesson_2
What is arrays, how to find max value of array, how to check if array sorted or not, how to use bubble sort and how to make a little modification to bubble sort, to increase it performance.
# lesson_3
What is selection sort, how to find min value of array(same as max, but vice versa).
Pick minimal value in array and put it to the left pointer, left pointer moving to the right every iteration(j in selection_sort.py)
